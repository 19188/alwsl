> We are currently looking for a somewhat experienced Windows reverse engineer to join this project. If you know one, or you are one, please write to minxomat@gmail.com or alwsl-dev@googlegroups.com.

This project provides an easy way to install a custom, minimal, arch linux distribution as the WSL host. The first developer preview is set to be released in the course of this week (before Oct 28).

If you want to try it right now, clone and run the alwsl batch file from a non-admin command prompt. But I encourage you to wait for the stable version (it's only a few days ;-))
