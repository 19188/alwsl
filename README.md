This project provides an easy way to install a custom, minimal, arch linux distribution as the WSL host.

If you want to try it right now, clone and run the alwsl batch file from a non-admin command prompt. 

### Status

We are currently negotiating with potential sponsors for a more stable delivery system for rootfs images and future updates to guarantee availability in all region at all times. In the meantime I have temporarily switched to a different internal CDN that should be faster. **If you still have an old copy of the batch script, where the CDN URL is not ___"antiquant.com"___, please download the current one!**

The next version will be released if a sponsor contract is signed. Current status: signing.
