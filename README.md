This project provides an easy way to install a custom, minimal, arch linux distribution as the WSL host.

If you want to try it right now, clone and run the alwsl batch file from a non-admin command prompt. 

###### Update Mar 2017

We are happy to announce Fastly as a sponsor for a reliable and global delivery of alwsl root images and future updates. Fastly commited a monthly four-figure credit to the alwsl project which will help with alwsl's transition into a new version later this month.
